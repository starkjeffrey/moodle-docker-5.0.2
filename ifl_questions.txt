We have been learning about causes and effects, and different ways you can write the effects of different causes.  You need to think about what you may want to do in your life to feel successful, whatever that means to you. Success is not the same for everybody.  Think about what it means to you, and write about the three thing that you must do (causes) that will have the outcomes (effects) that you want. So cluster and/or brainstorm your ideas about what you want in life, and what you need to do to make your dream become real.  Then write a thesis statement that clearly says the 3 things you must do to be successful in life.  Then write 3 body paragraphs where you go into detail and give specifics about your ideas. Use the form of statements we learned on pages 147-149 to say what you will need to do and why. Prepare an outline with your thesis statement and notes for your body paragraphs and conclusion.\n	0	0
