echo "1. ✅ Added grade categories to 311 IFL courses"
echo "2. ✅ Created 4 assessment types per course (Speaking, Writing, Reading, Listening)"
echo "3. ✅ Set weights to 25% each for balanced language assessment"
echo "4. ✅ Configured pass grades at 60% for each component"

echo "Next steps:"
echo "• Teachers can now enter grades directly in Moodle"
